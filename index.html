  <p> Dear Varshu ❤️ , 
    <br>
    <br>

As I sit down to write this email, my heart is pounding with excitement and nerves. But I know in my heart that what I'm about to ask you is something I've wanted for a long time.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    
    

Varshuu, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to wake up every morning to your beautiful smile, go on adventures with you, laugh with you, and hold your hand through the good times and the bad.
    <br>
    <br>

I know we've talked about our future together before, but I wanted to take this moment to formally ask for your hand in marriage. I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else, and I truly believe that we were meant to be together.
    <br>
    <br>

I promise to love you unconditionally, to support you in everything you do, and to always be there for you. I promise to be your partner, your best friend, and your soulmate.
    <br>
    <br>

So, Varshuu, will you marry me?
    <br>
    <br>

I can't wait to spend the rest of my life making you happy and building a beautiful future together.
    <br>
    <br>

With all my love,
Mr Vinay❤️</p>
